## Description
This is a reusable functions folder designed to simplify the use of generic utilities and visual effects (VFX) through a single macro command. Originally created for projects like Minecraft SSB, this library is now available for other datapack creators to integrate into their own work.

## Setup Instructions
*Assumes you already know how to set up datapacks.*

1. Place the `generic` folder inside your datapack's `functions` directory.

2. Import the required tag files into the `tags` folder located in the same directory as your `functions` folder.

3. Run the setup function once using this in-game command:
   ```mcfunction
   /function <datapackName>:setup

4. Add the following to your `tick` function:
   ```mcfunction
   execute as @e[type=area_effect_cloud] at @s run function <datapackName>:generic/vfx/assign_tasks/to_aecs

5. Use an IDE such as VSCode to replace all instances of `kits:` with your own namespace.

## How to Use
To use the generic functions or VFX:
1. Browse the folders to find the feature you want.
2. Open the file named `play` or `start` inside that folder.
3. Copy the example function call provided in the file.
4. Adjust the parameters as needed for your specific use case.

**Note:** Any parameter labeled as 'function' in the example call must be replaced with a complete, syntactically correct command.
